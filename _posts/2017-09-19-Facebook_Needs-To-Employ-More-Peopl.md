Conceived as a platform to let people over the world connect with each other, Facebook has come a long way. Darwin's theory of the fittest trumps (pun not intentionally intended) all holds true in the social-media space as well. Facebook has evolved and achieved the massively impressively feat to become one of the world's largest corporations obviating Orkut, Myspace and the likes.



In its continuing saga of influence and dominance, it's become the biggest disseminator of news over the Internet. The star player who's driven this coup - News Feed. An innocuous stream of information about your friends and families, inadvertently turned into a conduit of eclectic content. 



Popularity of News Feed has been incredulous for two reasons. First, it fairly keeps the feeding the user with the stories about people or causes they care and keeps them updated. Simple idea paired with great implementation. Secondly, it promoted the stories of corrupt and invalid stories in the same tune. Alarming, isn't it?  



Facebook had discovered its niche. Soon, it became the most preferred platform for everyone from Justin in Tulsa to Justin Timberlake in LA. It became a self-ingratiating, obsequious instrument that inflated the ego of the importance-seeking attention that humans constantly crave, a machine which would let users create, share and like stories about themselves and let others do the same. 



Future looked scintillating with billions of dollars pouring in from sales of ads to keep this machine churning. But like Uncle Ben said, 'With great power, comes great responsibility'. Time has now come to look back at the consequences of its greatest invention that were not anticipated earlier. The reason which allowed Facebook to let these changes happen at such a rapid pace was that it employed the brightest minds of the world to automate a lot of its operations. Though, the algorithm to populate the users' feed was updated and optimized continually, the moral regulation is non-existent or unsophisticated. 



Ads targeting Jewish haters, Pope endorsing Donald Trump, its role of undue influence in the 2016 Presidential elections are the news which would have invited derision and contempt from most of the humans. However these are realities. This has happened. And no-one was looking until now. 



Traditional newspapers and magazine writers go through scores of contexts, history, fact-checks, determine the veracity and multiple rounds of editing before they publish even a single piece of news. Being the biggest publisher of content today, Facebook, however doesn't go through any of these pain-staking processes and just promotes them. No filter. It operates on a model which is prone to manipulation to promotes stories. A medium that has become one's most loyal follower and the most powerful one as well. 



Facebook has to now bear responsibility to tweak its model. It'd bode well for the company which has worked strenuously over the years to make the world a better place needs to reorient it's ship again. This time, they need to hire more HUMANS. More humans are needed to manage and supervise the content that it markets till the time its automated algorithms mature enough to more responsible content in the News Feed. And of course, connecting the people in the right spirit and making the world a better place! :)
