My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1074460199">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Despite the stellar reviews and recommendation by Bill Gates, I was still holding out from expecting much from this book. But boy, did it exceed expectations! It was enjoyable to read a love-story written from the perspective of a man who's clinically unable to empathize, unable to love. <br /><br />It was truly enlightening to read the account of life from the view of an offbeat character Don, who's self-diagnosed to be autistic. Despite being wired to not experience empathy, there are numerous occasions from his sister's and Daphne's death, the difficult situation of his student who's found to be cheating in his assignments, him being unable to help himself and go to unbelievable extent to help Rosie find her biological father, change himself to make himself suitable for Rosie's love. All this makes for a wonderful, heart-warming read. It'll make you laugh as you read Don's inner thoughts and smile ear-to-ear when you read the end. <br /><br />Just the end reveal of Rosie's biological father which has been the chase in the entire book seems rushed by the author. It was a little obscure. Also the part about why Phil hits Gene is not clear. Barring these, the book was a fun read! Definitely recommend! <br /><br />PS - A very unfair comparison is made to the character of Sheldon from 'The Big Bang Theory'. The only attribute is that they're both socially awkward.
