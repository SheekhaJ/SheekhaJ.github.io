<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport">Cal Newport</a>
<br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3520786254">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Tremendously useful book underlining the value provided by deep work. <br /><br />First part of the book attempts to convince the readers about the importance of deep work. <br />Second part of the book describes the methods to help you adopt the practice of deep work. <br /><br />In short, read it and follow the advice. DEEP WORK IS VALUABLE, DEEP WORK IS RARE, DEEP WORK IS MEANINGFUL. 
<br /><br />Instead of trying to cram the amazing takeaways from this book in my review here, I've decided to create a read-only Google doc with my notes, which are in effect summary of this book, for those who're interested in reading it. <br />I'm going to re-edit this post with the link once ready. Feel free to create a copy or share it with others. <br /><br />Edit - As promised, here's the link to the Google doc - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfZ4V4GUFDGr3Q1aki_sZEbnlsTCusco5pcrn_q2ZMU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b...</a>
