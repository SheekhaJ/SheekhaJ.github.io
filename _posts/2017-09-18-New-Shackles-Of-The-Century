My earlier blog titled The vain right to privacy seems like an extension to the article by Harvard Business Review discussing about rise of the hub economy.

Being composed and regulated by companies of scale and magnitude such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and the likes, the hub economy, shows no signs of abatement. Accounting the tide and ebb trends witnessed in sustenance of these companies in the past two decades and their consequent emergence as the pioneers of the new era has eliminated all the doubts, if any, that these new-age companies are changing the course of humanity unlike anything before.

With Microsoft and Apple in 1970s, Google and Amazon in the late 1990s, and Facebook in the early 2000s, the simple idea of getting all the information in the world to the hands of the people snowballed to the now hackneyed phrase of making the world a better place. In their stated noble quest of disbursing information and giving people easy access to connect with other people, the ubiquity and permeance of  these companies has grown tremendously in the recent time. Concurrently, while enjoying the benefits of being always connected with friends and all the devices which have become extension of humans, the consumers are giving up something extremely valuable.

These companies did succeed in achieving their goal, but there came a slew of unimaginable consequences as a result of the advancements made by these companies. The enriching life that we're used to living now has it's own price. With help of our name, mobile number, email, search preference, shopping habits, wish-lists, likes, shares, credit-card and banking information, the users have voluntarily ceded possession of their personal information to these companies.

Collectively, these hub companies own our virtual identity. Even if these companies pledge to protect the user data, there's no dearth of people with questionable intentions working towards raiding the jackpot of this information. And even one successful attempt of breaching these walls of security by some nefarious individual or clan can lead to serious threat to the real identity of users.

Identity threat is the biggest cyber crime plaguing the society in this information age. The new-age attacks like WannaCry ransomware and the Equifax security attack are the latest evidences of the threat posed to our sensitive personal information. Lack of vigil over the ways this information is stored, maintained, transacted and protected makes the entire economy highly vulnerable.

The pervasiveness of these companies has now made it impossible to retract one's steps and avoid sharing one's personal information. However, it's imperative that an independent think-tank is established to be watchful of the practices adopted by these companies and work towards safety of users' data. The election to these think-tanks and leadership of  these hub companies needs to be more careful as it'll be highly crucial to charting the future of humanity. Thus, it remains to be defined how will the world navigate the shift in economy with these new shackles.
