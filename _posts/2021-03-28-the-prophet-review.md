My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3913713075">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Not a book I'd normally pick but it was recommended by a friend. This book has withstood the test of time, translated to over 100 languages and is still in print. Says a lot about how far has it resonated with people around the world. Printed in 1923, the book is a short collection of 26 fables. <br /><br />Al Mustafa, a prophet from city of Orphalese on his departure from the city is sought by different residents to share his wisdom about various things in life ranging from love, friendship, marriage, children, giving, time, pain, religion, joy & sorrow, good & evil, etc. <br /><br />If you're used to reading contemporary books or if you're at the stage in life when you're in rush of things then you might not enjoy reading it much. However, it's one of those books that age well. However, if you go back to this book from time to time at different stages in your life then it might reveal a completely different meaning for you. And that's why this book is a piece of timeless wisdom of life.
