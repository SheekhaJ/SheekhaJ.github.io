title: "The Vain Right To Privacy"

Google pledges to protect privacy of its users. So, does Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the others of the tech cohort. Scores of pages are written and campaigns are run to reaffirm their support in this credo. But are they to be really believed?

Not so sensationalized are the reports of these firms paying fine going up to millions of dollars on several occasions when found in violation of the same sacred right (which the users take for granted). Being a regular subscriber to Google's blog, it's worth nothing that such a story has never appeared in the newsletter. Nor do these reports trend in the search results. It's shady.

For all the fault of theirs and ours as users, the right to privacy is a vain cry in the abyss of the internet. I bet most of the users love it when hundreds of friends are reminded by Facebook to wish them birthday; celebrate their friendship and design a charming collage of all their beautiful pictures from the year. Similarly, the rush of endorphin and dopamine when you have people oohing, aahing  and crushing over your silly pictures is too unhealthy to be fought. Because of the way we revel in the services provided by these companies, it's difficult to imagine even the users would give it a fight to death for their privacy.

Hidden in those voluminous paragraphs of terms and conditions are the ammunition that these companies stealthily fight with to continue using all this information about its users. Anything that is too complicated to be simplified is the recipe to disaster. Everyone is requested to hold their horses as another post elaborating on this will be published soon.

While these companies do face the heat for these transgressions, it's time that users also acknowledge their role in fueling the situation of lack of privacy. It's almost impossible to find a user who's read, understood and accepted the terms and conditions put forward by these companies in their fair state of mind. Users are inherently erratic in their optimism by having implicit trust on some mythical entity to fight for their right. Also worth noting is that the outburst is contained if not absent until some incident puts their image under shameful view. Putting these companies solely on stand for invasion of users privacy is also not entirely fair.

With the rise of highly customer-specific services and the Utopian view of exaltation, approbation or even cognizance of user's every actions, the trend is far from dampening. These primary source of revenue for these companies is advertising. Advertising the products and services to the customers who are looking them up or liking them are in turn responsible for driving the sales of the clients. In today's age of information deluge, it's very easy to track and construct an identity of any individual by using the information of their search habits, ad-clicking, page-liking, channel-subscribing behavior and time spent on using these services. Each and every click and key-stroke is data waiting to be interpreted by the ever-so intelligent algorithms running indefatigably and discreetly.

Information is inconspicuously conspicuous power. And it's with the very hands of the users that it's shared with these companies. It's been more imperative than ever for user to be more vigilant and aware of the information that they share on these platforms as to avoid falling victim to crimes of identity fraud, cyber-abuse, image-shaming and slander. User is its own guardian in this world!
