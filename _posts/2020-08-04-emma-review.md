My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/402165476">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
What a fun to read! Jane Austen has a way of connecting with readers through her timeless story-telling of a plot that has been loved by readers through generations! <br /><br />As compared to current day conversations and the length of novels, this can seem tiresome but funny and entertaining nonetheless. The goodwill and vanity of the protagonist and the ensuing admonition from Mr. Knightley, guileless Harriet Smith, comedic Miss Bates and her incessant exaltation, reserve of Jane Fairfax, flamboyance of Frank Churchill, kindhearted Mrs. Weston and the tiresome ostentation of Mrs. Elton - this novel promises thorough amusement! <br /><br />And as always, I'd recommend reading the book before watching the movie! :)
