title: "Neuralink - Elon Musk's Ambitious New Venture"

Musk is a very busy man! He's got his hands full of Tesla, SpaceX and OpenAI. And he wasn't satisfied! He wanted to make a bigger difference to the world! He likes to keep himself occupied and drain the last bit of his energy to keep Earth habitable (with electric cars and getting people to adopt solar energy as a primary source of energy with Tesla). And in case all this doesn't work he's also got plans to get Mars a backup place for humans to live on. Make humans an inter-planetary species and make the current civilization a space-faring one. He's got a vision and the means to realize the vision. 

Vision and the drive to realize the vision are two extremely important values that can change the world! Anything and everything will fall into place if you have a vision and drive to realize it. You can find people to make it work for you even if you don't have the right set of skills yourself. And you can always learn.

Coming back to his latest venture - Neuralink. I tweeted about him purchasing this name from two professors just two days back. And looking back at the Recode conference last year when he was interviewed by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, he did his best to keep things under wrap by talking about something called 'neural lace'. Had I written this blog then I wouldn't have put the quotes around neural lace. After the official announcement of Neuralink, Google autocompletes a search query of 'Elon Musk neural lace video' and lead you to the Recode conference. 

So yeah, Musk subtly announced his new venture by just retweeting WaitButWhy's tweet about the article elaborating more about it! He truly is a busy busy man! He basically hired a guy to do all the talking. Now you start reading the article and get hooked up with all the cartoons and the illustrations to keep the read interesting. Laudable work by Tim Urban @WaitButWhy to start out simple and lead the reader with the whole story of why Elon thought it was important to tread this road and what he's set out to do. Urban is a also a visionary in his own sense to have the incredible ability to deliver such an elaborate and riveting development. 

Mind it, it's a very long article. Also have the long attention span and the inquisitiveness to keep you going through it. Now I've gone through the article. And here's a part of the article which explains with few sketches why Musk has started Neuralink. 

I'll jump directly to Part 3 where the real crux of the story is. 















































So that's the last of the strip which defines the problem of obsolete form of communication that Musk is set out to solve. 

Till the next post, I'd suggest everyone to wrap their minds around this and think about how they'd advance the current methods of communication. :) 

And for those bold readers, here's the link to the original post by Urban Neuralink and the Brain's magical future.
