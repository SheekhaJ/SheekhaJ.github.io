title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Sheekha Jariwala! 

I graduated recently with a Masters in Computer Science from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/ "Home page of Oregon State University") where I was a student in the [School of EECS](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ "Home page of School of EECS at Oregon State University"). 

I've had the privilege to have [Dr. Christopher Scaffidi](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/scaffidi-christopher) as my advisor. I've been part of the [Software Innovation Track](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/future-students/graduate/ms-cs-innovation) where the focus is to create real systems which are *novel* and *improvement* on existing systems. I'm eternally grateful to Chris for instilling such important values and teaching invaluable tips which has prepared me to work productively in field of Software Engineering in the industry.
